# Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. ... NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python's built-in sequences.
USES - 
Numpy is one of the most commonly used packages for scientific computing in Python. It provides a multidimensional array object, as well as variations such as masks and matrices, which can be used for various math operations.
WORKING - 
NumPy offers many ways to do array indexing. Slicing: Just like lists in python, NumPy arrays can be sliced. As arrays can be multidimensional, you need to specify a slice for each dimension of the array. Integer array indexing: In this method, lists are passed for indexing for each dimension
